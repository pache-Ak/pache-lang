# A new compiler language project

---

This is a exercise and experimental project.

It doesn't have name until today.

To know it please see directory [docs](/docs).
It is not finished and will change gradually.

The grammar design has been preliminarily completed and will still be modified in the future.

I have completed a small amount of AST design and Bison program, and considering that the grammar has not been finalized, no further work will be done at this time.

The document still needs to be repaired, depending on further design.

Currently, the language design focuses on the compilation process and optimization process, and there will be no more PR (pull requests) until it is improved.
